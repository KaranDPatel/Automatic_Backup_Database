**Automated Database Backup and Email Notification System**

**Overview**

This project provides an automated system for backing up both MongoDB and MySQL databases. It also includes functionality to send email notifications upon successful completion of the backup process. The backup process is scheduled to run periodically using Python's schedule library.

**Features**

MongoDB Backup: Automatically backs up all collections from a MongoDB database into JSON files.

MySQL Backup: Automates the backup process of a MySQL database using a batch script.

Email Notifications: Sends an email notification with the backup files attached once the backup is completed.

Scheduling: Uses the schedule library to run the backup process at specified intervals.

**Prerequisites**

-Python 3.x installed on your system.

-MongoDB and MySQL databases set up and running.

-pymongo: MongoDB client for Python.

-schedule: Python job scheduling library.

-smtplib: Python library to send emails.

-MySQL client tools installed, particularly mysqldump.

**Installation**

Clone the repository:

-git clone url

Install required Python packages:

-pip install pymongo schedule
-Set up your MongoDB and MySQL connection details in the backup_db() and autobackupmysql() functions, respectively.

Set up your email credentials in the send_email() function.

**Usage**

MongoDB Backup

The backup_db() function connects to a MongoDB database, retrieves all collections, and saves them as JSON files in a specified directory.

MySQL Backup

The autobackupmysql() function triggers a MySQL backup using a batch file and sends the resulting SQL file as an email attachment.

Scheduling Backups

The schedule library is used to run the backup process at regular intervals. You can adjust the timing of the backups by modifying the scheduling line:

python

Copy code

schedule.every(1).minutes.do(autobackupmysql)

Run the Script

To start the backup and email notification process, simply run:

python your_script_name.py

**Email Configuration**

Ensure that your SMTP settings are correctly configured in the send_email() function.

For Gmail, make sure that "Allow less secure apps" is enabled or use an App Password.
